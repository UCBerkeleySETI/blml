# blml

This repository contains code and documentation from a workshop at UC Berkeley on June 2 and 3 2016. More recent ML development is now at https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/breakthrough/tree/master/ML

# Experiments

* `apf_demud`: Ran DEMUD novelty detection on APF spectra
* `gbt_demud`: Ran DEMUD novelty detection on GBT filterbank data 
  that had been converted into spectra by averaging across a 5-minute window
* `gbtfil_demud`: Ran DEMUD novelty detection on GBT filterbank data (2D)
* `gbt_cluster`: Re-sampled GBT data and ran clustering results on extracted features (Umaa and Jasper)
* `hitrecords_cluster`: Looking for clustering in SETI@home and SERENDIP hit records.
